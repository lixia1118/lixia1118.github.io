I hold a Ph.D. in Business Administration with a specialized focus on **Corporate Environmentalism** in general. My research delves deeply into **Corporate Green Innovation**, **Corporate Sustainability**, and **Corporate Social Responsibility/ESG**.

I am particularly interested in:

- The ways in which firms respond to their social performance feedback.
- The driving factors that encourage or discourage firms from developing green innovation.
- The (dis)advantages that green innovation brings to firms.
- When, How, and Why firms calibrate their green innovation strategies under some certain circumstances.
