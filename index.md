## About Me

I am a D.Phil. candidate in Computer Science at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), co-supervised by Profs. [Niki Trigoni](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/niki.trigoni/) and [Andrew Markham](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.markham/).

I plan on submitting my thesis in the coming months and will soon be entering the job market. Feel free to contact me for any research opportunities!

## Research Interests

My research interests primarily focus on advancing robotics and autonomous systems, particularly in achieving human-level perception and comprehensive environmental understanding for mobile robotic platforms. I aim to develop cutting-edge AI techniques and methodologies to enable robust and efficient spatial perception solutions, enhancing the reliability, intelligence, and security of intelligent machines in real-world scenarios. Additionally, my research includes efficient camera localization using state space models for edge-cloud collaborative IoT and terminal devices, further enhancing AI applications in these areas.

**Techniques**: Visual Localization, Adversarial Training, Data Augmentation, Domain Adaptation, 3D Reconstruction, and Neural Rendering

**Applications**: Autonomous Driving, Robotics, Virtual Reality, edge-cloud collaborative IoT and terminal devices
